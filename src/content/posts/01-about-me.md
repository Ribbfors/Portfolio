## Why I started programming

I've always liked tech and had an interest to learn how things work.
I started creating websites with the help of `Elementor` and `WordPress` in the end of 2019.

After a while I found out that you could create custom elements with `HTML`, so I started learning it.

Along with HTML, I learned `CSS` and eventually `Javascript` to enhance the feel and capabilities of my websites.

After a long period of time spent on Javascript I started poking around with `React` and I just enjoyed it so much that I decided to learn it.

## What I'm doing now

Today I work as a fulltime developer and in my sparetime I am working on my own projects.

I am trying to enhance my skills as much as possible and I want to learn more!

I also have a huge interest in `Network Security` and when I don't code I try to learn more about it, something that my Raspberry Pi helps me with.

This was just a brief introduction, when I get the feeling of writing, I will create some programming related posts.
